# Connections

Welcome to **Connections**, an interactive resource for exploring biblical people, places, tribes, and themes. This project visualizes relationships across the Bible and related sources, providing a rich reference for pastors, scholars, and curious readers alike.

Connections was created by a software engineer with a passion for biblical studies. It applies **network and graph theory** to connect ideas, themes, people, and places, offering both intuitive exploration and scholarly depth.

## What Connections Does

- Maps biblical relationships: who is connected to whom, familial lineages, tribal affiliations, and thematic links.  
- Each **page** includes references, notes, and visualizations showing its **connections** to other pages.  
- Includes **Old Testament, New Testament, and extra-biblical references** for every page.  
- Highlights **strong and weak connections** to help identify important links and scholarly debates.  
- Supports **modular expansion**: new pages, connections, or categories can be added via structured data (YAML) files.
