# Project Status
Hey, you found the project status page... you must be interested beyond the typical user--welcome!

## Phase 1: POC
- Completed 2025-09-04 (ish)
- Demonstrate the graphs in a manual way that seemed promising!

## Phase 2: Core Build
- Completed 2025-09-13
- refactor/rename/rebuild so it's scalable/testable/usable - done!
- nice to haves:
  - transition away from makefile, I need a better script runner framework - done 2025-09-12
  - move static files to their own location so a clean build can be done more simply and comprehensively - done 2025-09-13
  - identify a good way to add incrementally instead of rebuilding everything. versions on nodes? - punt
  - create a way to heal/suggest missing reciprocal links - punt

## Phase 3: Import Ruth
- In progress
- all of Ruth links--mostly by hand according to defined categories
  - While it is far slower to do by hand. I'm already coming away with fresh insights from the first chapter of Ruth. For example, I always thought Elimelech's kids married before he died and then they all died over time, but it looks like he died then Naomi arranged marriages for his sons to foreign women. Also, it looks like Ruth and Orpah may have been infertile--which would put Ruth into a whole pattern of miraculous conceptions. Maybe there's something to the by-hand method--however slow that maybe.
- this does not include any academic resources, just Bible

## Phase 4: Torah
- add subscription/support ability (who knows, maybe this can become a career instead of a weekend project)
- share with trusted academics/pastors/influencers
- complete Ge-De

## Phase 5
- See where it goes?
