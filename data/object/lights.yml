description:
  en: 'The lights in the heavens have been interpreted to be the literal sun, moon and stars
    as well as the spiritual beings that they represented in the ancient world. They are the
    only other creature given authority to rule in the Genesis account, which gives credence
    to the idea that they are more than just physical objects.'
