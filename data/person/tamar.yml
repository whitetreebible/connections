description:
  en: Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah and the mother of Perez and Zerah. After
    the death of her husband Er, who was Judah's firstborn son, Tamar was left childless.
    According to the custom of levirate marriage, she was supposed to marry her husband's
    brother, Onan, to produce offspring in Er's name. However, Onan refused to fulfill
    this duty and was subsequently killed by God. Judah then promised to give his
    youngest son, Shelah, to Tamar when he came of age, but he failed to do so. In
    response, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and seduced Judah, resulting
    in the birth of twins, Perez and Zerah. Perez is significant as an ancestor of
    King David and, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ.
