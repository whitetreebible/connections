description:
  en: 'Tamar was the daughter-in-law of Judah and the mother of Perez and Zerah. After the death of her husband
    Er, who was Judah''s firstborn son, Tamar was left childless. According to the custom of levirate marriage,
    she was supposed to marry her husband''s brother, Onan, to produce offspring in Er''s name. However,
    Onan refused to fulfill this duty and was subsequently killed by God. Judah then promised to give
    his youngest son, Shelah, to Tamar when he came of age, but he failed to do so. In response, Tamar
    disguised herself as a prostitute and seduced Judah, resulting in the birth of twins, Perez and Zerah.
    Perez is significant as an ancestor of King David and, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ.'
