description:
  en: 'Ruth is the Moabite daughter-in-law of Naomi. After the deaths of her
    husband and father-in-law, she chooses to stay with Naomi and return to Bethlehem.
    There, she gleans in the fields of Boaz, who later marries her. Ruth is the great-grandmother
    of King David and an ancestor of Jesus Christ. Her story is one of loyalty, faith,
    and divine providence as well as Gentile inclusion in the lineage of the Messiah.'
footnotes:
  death_ordering:
    en: 10 years of marriage without children may indicate infertility for both [[person/orpah]]
      and [[person/ruth]] (Robert Whiting, 2025).
  feet:
    en: '"Opening the feet" is a euphemism for sexual relations. It is unclear what
      exactly Ruth did, but it was likely more than just uncovering his feet while
      he slept (Robert Whiting, 2025).'
  wing:
    en: Boaz says in 2:1 "May Yahweh reward your work and may a full reward be given
      to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you came to take refuge"
      and in 3:9, Ruth asks him to "Spread your wing over your servant because you
      are a redeemer." This is likely an allusion to Ruth taking refuge under the
      wings of God, and Boaz is being asked to symbolically do the same by spreading
      his "wing" (sometimes translated garment) over her. This is a culturally significant
      gesture indicating protection and care, akin to the way God protects His people
      (Robert Whiting, 2025).
  conception:
    en: '"Yahweh enabled her to conceive" indicates that Ruth had difficulty conceiving
      and Yahweh overcame said difficulties (Robert Whiting, 2025).'
