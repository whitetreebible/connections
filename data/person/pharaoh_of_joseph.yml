description:
  en: 'Pharaoh is the title used for the ancient Egyptian monarchs. In the
    Book of Genesis, the Pharaoh during Joseph''s time plays a significant role in
    the narrative, particularly in relation to Joseph''s rise to power and the
    events leading to the migration of Jacob''s family to Egypt. In order to differentiate
    this Pharaoh from others mentioned in the Bible, he is often referred to as
    "Pharaoh of Joseph" or "the Pharaoh who knew not Joseph." Pharaoh is also used to 
    refer to the ruling household or dynasty--as a broader term.'
