description:
  en: 'Perez was the son of Judah and Tamar, making him an important figure in the lineage of King David.
    His birth is notable because it occurred under unusual circumstances, as Tamar disguised
    herself as a prostitute to seduce Judah after he failed to fulfill his duty to provide
    her with a husband from his family. Perez is recognized as an ancestor of King David
    and, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ.'
