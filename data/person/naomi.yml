description:
  en: 'Naomi was the wife of Elimelech and the mother-in-law of Ruth. She was originally 
       from Bethlehem in Judah but moved to Moab with her husband and two sons during a 
       time of famine. After the deaths of her husband and sons, Naomi decided to return 
       to Bethlehem. Her story is one of loss, faith, and redemption, as she encourages 
       Ruth to stay with her and ultimately finds hope through Ruth''s marriage to Boaz, 
       which leads to their inclusion in the lineage of King David.'
