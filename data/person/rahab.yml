description:
  en: "Rahab was a [[tribe/canaan]] woman in [[place/jericho]] who hid the [[tribe/israel]]\
    \ spies sent by [[person/joshua]]. \nBecause of her actions, she and her family\
    \ were spared during the conquest of the city.[^test_footnote]\nShe is later mentioned\
    \ in the genealogy of Jesus in [[bible:Matthew 1:5]] and praised for her faith\
    \ in [[bible:Hebrews 11:31]]. \nScholars note that she should not be confused\
    \ with the [[creature/rahab_monster]] mentioned in [[bible:Psalm 89:10]] and [[bible:Job\
    \ 26:12]].\nRahab's story bridges the Old and New Testaments. Some extra-biblical\
    \ sources, like Josephus[^josephus_note_1], recount her story in a similar way\
    \ to [[bible:Joshua 2]].\nHer inclusion among women in [[person/jesus]]' genealogy\
    \ is notable and discussed in multiple commentaries. Scholarly debate exists on\
    \ the historical versus symbolic elements of her story.\n"
