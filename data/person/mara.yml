description:
  en: 'Mara is the name that Naomi adopts for herself after experiencing great personal loss.
       The name "Mara" means "bitter" in Hebrew, reflecting her feelings of sorrow and hardship
       following the deaths of her husband Elimelech and her two sons, Mahlon and Kilion.
       Naomi''s choice to call herself Mara signifies her deep grief and the challenges she faces
       as a widow in a foreign land. Despite this, the story of Naomi and her daughter-in-law
       Ruth ultimately leads to redemption and hope, as Ruth''s loyalty and faithfulness result
       in their restoration and inclusion in the lineage of King David. '
