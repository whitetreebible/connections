description:
  en: 'Kilion was one of the two sons of Elimelech and Naomi, who moved with their family
    from Bethlehem in Judah to Moab during a time of famine. Kilion married a Moabite after
    the death of his father, but he later died in Moab, leaving his wife a widow.s'

  death_ordering:
    en: In my imagination, Elimelech was alive for the marriage of his son, but the
      text does not say that explicitly, infact, it seems to indicate he was not involved
      in the marriage of his sons to foreign women (Robert Whiting, 2025).
