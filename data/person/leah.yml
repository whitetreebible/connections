description:
  en: 'Leah was the first wife of Jacob and the mother of six of his twelve sons, who became
    the ancestors of six of the twelve tribes of Israel. She was the daughter of Laban and the
    older sister of Rachel. Leah''s story is one of love, rivalry, and faithfulness, as she
    bore children to Jacob while Rachel, whom he loved more, remained barren for a time. 
    Despite the challenges she faced, Leah is remembered for her significant role in the 
    lineage of the Israelite people, particularly as the mother of Judah, from whom the
    Davidic line would come.'
