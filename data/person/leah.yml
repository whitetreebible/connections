  en: Leah (first wife of Jacob)
description:
  en: Leah was the first wife of Jacob and the mother of six of his twelve sons, who
    became the ancestors of six of the twelve tribes of Israel. She was the daughter
    of Laban and the older sister of Rachel. Leah's story is one of love, rivalry,
    and faithfulness, as she bore children to Jacob while Rachel, whom he loved more,
    remained barren for a time. Despite the challenges she faced, Leah is remembered
    for her significant role in the lineage of the Israelite people, particularly
    as the mother of Judah, from whom the Davidic line would come.
