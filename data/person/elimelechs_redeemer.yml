  elimelechs_redeemer:
    en: The redeemer of whom Boaz had spoken is not named, but he is likely a close
      relative of Elimelech, possibly a brother or cousin. He has the first right
      of right/responsibility of redeem the land and marry Ruth according to the custom
      of levirate marriage (Robert Whiting, 2025).
  unsandaled_one:
    en: The "unsandaled one" is a reference to [[bible:Leviticus 25:9]], "she shall 
      pull off his sandal from his foot, and she shall spit in his face," which describes 
      a shameful practice where the kinsman-redeemer is publicly humiliated, apparently 
      it had been normalized by this time into an accepted cultural practice (Robert Whiting, 2025).
