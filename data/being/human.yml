description:
  en: 'Adam means "human" or "humanity" in Hebrew. The term is used in the Bible to 
    refer to the first human created by God, as well as to humanity in general. According 
    to [[bible:Genesis 1:26-27]], humans were created in the image of God, which signifies 
    a special status and relationship with the divine. This concept is foundational in 
    Judeo-Christian theology, emphasizing the dignity and worth of every human being. 
    Humans are distinct from other creatures due to their responsibility to steward creation.'
