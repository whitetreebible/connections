description:
  en: The Moabites were descendants of Moab, the son of Lot and his older daughter.
    They settled in the region east of the Dead Sea, in what is now modern-day Jordan.
    The Moabites had a complex relationship with the Israelites, often marked by conflict
    but also by periods of peace and intermarriage, as seen in the story of Ruth,
    a Moabite woman who became the great-grandmother of King David.
