description:
  en: Moab was an ancient kingdom located east of the Dead Sea, in what is now modern-day
    Jordan. It was inhabited by the Moabites, who were descendants of Lot, the nephew
    of Abraham. The Moabites are frequently mentioned in the Bible, often in relation
    to the Israelites. The relationship between the two peoples was complex, marked
    by both conflict and cooperation. Notably, Ruth, the Moabite woman who became
    the great-grandmother of King David, is a key figure in this narrative, illustrating
    the intertwined destinies of the Moabites and Israelites.
