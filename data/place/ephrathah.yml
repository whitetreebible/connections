    It is located in the region of Judah and is famously known as the birthplace of King David
    and, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ. Bethlehem is often associated with themes
    of humility and divine providence, as it was a small town chosen by God for these monumental
    events. The town is mentioned multiple times in the Bible, particularly in the books of Ruth,
    Samuel, and the Gospels.'
